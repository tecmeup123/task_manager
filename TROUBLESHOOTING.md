## Authentication Issues

### Cannot Log In

**Problem**: Unable to log in despite using correct credentials.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the account has been approved by an admin (new accounts require approval)
2. Try clearing your browser cookies and cache
3. Ensure you're using the correct username (not email) for login
4. If it's your first login, make sure to use the temporary password provided
5. If you've forgotten your password, ask an admin to reset it

### Session Expires Too Quickly

**Problem**: Being logged out of the application too frequently.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your session timeout settings in your user preferences
2. Enable the "Remember Me" option when logging in
3. Ensure your device's time and date settings are correct
4. Check if you have browser extensions that might be clearing cookies

### Cannot Change Password

**Problem**: Password change fails with an error.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your new password meets the complexity requirements:
   - At least 8 characters
   - Contains at least one uppercase letter
   - Contains at least one lowercase letter
   - Contains at least one number
   - Contains at least one special character
2. Make sure you've correctly entered your current password
3. Try clearing browser cache and cookies

## Database Connection Problems

### Application Shows Database Error

**Problem**: Application displays database connection error messages.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the PostgreSQL service is running on the server
2. Verify that the DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly
3. Ensure the database user has the correct permissions
4. Check database logs for any potential issues
5. Verify network connectivity between the application server and database server

### Data Not Saving

**Problem**: Changes to tasks, editions, or other entities don't persist.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if you have the necessary permissions for the operation
2. Verify there are no validation errors in the form (look for red error messages)
3. Check the browser console for any API errors
4. Ensure the database has enough disk space
5. Verify database connection is stable

## Task Management Issues

### Cannot Create Tasks

**Problem**: Unable to create new tasks for an edition.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have Editor or Admin role
2. Check if the edition is archived (archived editions cannot have new tasks)
3. Ensure all required fields are filled in the task creation form
4. Check for unique constraint violations (e.g., duplicate task code)
5. Verify the selected week is valid for the edition

### Task Status Won't Update

**Problem**: Unable to update the status of tasks.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have Editor or Admin role
2. Check if the task is locked or marked as inflexible
3. Ensure the status transition is valid (e.g., can't revert "Done" tasks)
4. Refresh the page and try again
5. Check network connectivity

### Tasks Not Appearing in Dashboard

**Problem**: Tasks are not showing up in the dashboard.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the tasks exist in the specific edition view
2. Check if the tasks meet the dashboard criteria:
   - Overdue tasks: past due date and not complete
   - Upcoming tasks: due within the next 7 days
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Check filter settings that might be hiding tasks

## Edition Management Issues

### Cannot Create Edition

**Problem**: Unable to create a new edition.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have Editor or Admin role
2. Ensure the edition code follows the correct format (YYMM-[A/B])
3. Check if an edition with the same code already exists
4. Ensure all required fields are filled correctly
5. Verify date ranges are valid (start date before end date)

### Edition Duplication Fails

**Problem**: Unable to duplicate an existing edition.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have Editor or Admin role
2. Ensure the source edition exists and has tasks
3. Check if an edition with the new code already exists
4. Verify the database has enough space for the duplication
5. Check server logs for specific error messages

### Edition Status Not Updating

**Problem**: Edition status (upcoming, active, finished) not updating correctly.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the start and end dates are set correctly
2. Check if the currentWeek field is updated appropriately
3. Refresh the page to get the latest status
4. Check if the edition has been archived (affects status display)

## User Management Issues

### Cannot Create New Users

**Problem**: Unable to create new user accounts.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have Admin role
2. Check if a user with the same username already exists
3. Ensure all required fields are filled correctly
4. Verify email format is valid
5. Check if maximum user limit has been reached (if applicable)

### User Approval Not Working

**Problem**: Unable to approve new user accounts.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have Admin role
2. Check if the user has already been approved
3. Refresh the page and try again
4. Check server logs for specific error messages

### Cannot Delete Users

**Problem**: Unable to delete user accounts.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have Admin role
2. Admin accounts cannot be deleted
3. Check if the user owns any active resources or tasks
4. Try deactivating the user account instead of deleting

## Performance Issues

### Slow Page Loading

**Problem**: Pages take too long to load.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your network connection
2. Clear browser cache and reload
3. Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications
4. Check if the issue persists across different browsers
5. Verify server resources are adequate (CPU, memory)
6. Check if the database needs optimization

### High Server Load

**Problem**: Server experiencing high CPU or memory usage.

**Solutions**:
1. Check for long-running queries in the database
2. Verify the number of concurrent users is within expected limits
3. Implement database query optimizations
4. Consider adding database indexes for frequently accessed fields
5. Check for memory leaks in the application code
6. Scale server resources if necessary

## Progressive Web App Issues

4. Check if the build process completed successfully
5. Verify PostgreSQL is running and accessible
6. Check for port conflicts with other applications

### HTTPS Not Working

**Problem**: SSL certificate issues or HTTPS not functioning.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify SSL certificate is valid and not expired
2. Check Nginx configuration for proper SSL settings
3. Ensure certificate and key files are in the correct locations
4. Verify domain DNS settings point to the correct server
5. Try renewing the certificate using certbot

### Database Migration Issues
